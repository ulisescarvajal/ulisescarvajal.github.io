                        <p>PREAMBLE</p>
                        <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
                            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
                            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
                            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
                            with others.</p>
                        <p><br>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
                            redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
                            fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
                            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
                            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
                            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
                            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
                            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
                        <p><br>DEFINITIONS</p>
                        <p>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
                            Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
                            include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
                        <p><br>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
                            copyright statement(s).
                            <br><br>
                            "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
                            distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
                            <br><br>
                            "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
                            or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
                            Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
                            new environment.
                            <br><br>
                            "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
                            writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
                            <br><br>
                            PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
                            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
                            a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
                            redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
                            Software, subject to the following conditions:
                            <br><br>
                            1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
                            in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
                            <br><br>
                            2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
                            redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
                            contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
                            included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
                            in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
                            binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
                            <br><br>
                            3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
                            Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
                            Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
                            presented to the users.
                            <br><br>
                            4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
                            Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
                            Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
                            Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
                            permission.
                            <br><br>
                            5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
                            must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
                            distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
                            remain under this license does not apply to any document created
                            using the Font Software.
                            <br><br>
                            TERMINATION<br>
                            This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
                            not met.
                            <br><br>
                            DISCLAIMER<br>
                            THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

       <br><br>
       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
       and conversions to other media types.
       <br><br>
       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
       <br><br>
       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
       <br><br>
       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
       <br><br>
       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
       <br><br>
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
       <br><br>
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.
       <br><br>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:
       <br><br>
       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
           <br><br>
       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and
           <br><br>
       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and
           <br><br>
       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.
           <br><br>
       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

                            PREAMBLE<br>
                            The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
                            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
                            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
                            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
                            with others.
                            <br><br>
                            The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
                            redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
                            fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
                            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
                            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
                            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
                            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
                            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

                            1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
                            in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
                            <br><br>
